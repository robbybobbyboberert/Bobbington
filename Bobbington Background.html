  <h3>Background <em>Bob</em>bing<em>ton</em></h3>

  <p>After training extensively as a walrus whisperer, Mr 'Bob' Bobbington spent several years working as a freelance lancefreer before joining Mr Pennington's travelling band of minstrels as a tambourine player, First Class. Following a clash of opinions
    with Mr Pennington over the band's direction, Mr Bobbington upped sticks and embarked on a new career in the literal wilderness working 35 hours a week as an ice-cream bicycle delivery man serving postal addresses on the outskirts of the Sahara
    desert. More recently, Mr Bobbington has ventured into several new ventures, all of which have been hugely successful.</p>
